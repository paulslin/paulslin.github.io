**Project Description:** 
Grass-based biomes are one of the most important ecosystems and provide numerous crucial functions and services, yet remain as one of the world’s most vulnerable ecosystems today. In particular, the distribution of Plant Functional Types (PFT) between C3 grasses and C4 grasses are expected to shift dramatically due to grass’ sensitivity to changes in environmental factors. Within this study, a set of twelve annual phenological metrics were extracted from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profiles along five training clusters and three testing latitudinal transects between 2010 and 2020. Phenological metric value measurements from the training sites were used as features to construct machine learning models for predicting site PFT classification (C3-majority or C4-majority). The resulting predictions were used to analyze potential shifts in the spatiotemporal distribution of grass PFTs and its correlations with temperature and precipitation changes within the North American Great Plains. 

## Introduction
#### The Importance of Grasslands
Grasses and grass-based biomes play crucial roles in ecological functions and human development. Grass-based biomes (savannas, grasslands, and shrublands) span an area of over 4000 million ha and yield an annual total net primary productivity of 13.7 Pg C, approximately one-third of the Earth’s total land surface and total terrestrial productivity. Grass-based ecosystems serve important ecological functions as carbon storage reservoirs, nitrogen fixation sources, wildlife habitat, and water flow and quality regulators. Nonetheless, accelerated changes in climate and land use patterns have drastically reduced global grasslands cover in recent years, with natural grasslands areas having shrunk by 92%, the most significant reduction of any natural biomes. Within grasslands, changes in regional climate patterns have also induced significant shifts in the PFT distribution of C3 and C4 grasses with major global and regional implications. First, domesticated C3 and C4 grasses are critical to global agricultural productivity, with wheat (C3), rice (C3), and maize (C4) accounting for 20%, 19%, and 5% of the world’s global caloric intake respectively. Second, C3 grasses generally live longer and carry more biomass than C4 grasses, and so serve as better carbon reservoirs than C4 grasses. As such, even minor expansions or contractions of C3 and C4 grass territorial boundaries could have substantial impacts on global food security and the global carbon cycle.
#### Methods for Analyzing PFT Distribution
Past methods for analyzing PFT distribution have typically utilized field-collected measurements of carbon isotope concentration to classify sites as C3-majority or C4-majority. However, field-collected measurements are often constrained by high costs, infrequent and limited spatial coverage, and coarse temporal resolution. As such, PFT classification methods classification metrics derived from remotely-sensed measurements have become increasingly popular due to the low cost, regular and high spatial coverage, and fine temporal resolution produced by remotely-sensed measurements. One such method for site PFT classification is based on the asynchronous seasonal profiles between C3 and C4 plants in which C3 plants exhibit greater photosynthetic activity in the moist and cool spring and late fall while C4 plant exhibit greater photosynthetic activity in the dry and hot summer. Consequentially, C3-majority and C4-majority sites yield different ranges of values for temporal-based phenological metrics such as date of onset of greenness (season start), date of end of greenness (season end), date of maximum greenness, and duration of greenness (season length), all of which can be used for classification purposes. As such, this study will utilize these temporal-based metrics as features for building a site PFT classifier.

## Datasets
- **[National Ecological Network (NEON)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10058.001)**: NEON product DP1.10058.001 (Plant Species Presence and Percent Cover) documents the existing plant species and their respective percent cover at multiple sample plots located within NEON Terrestrial Observations System (TOS) sites. NEON product DP1.10058.001 data were used in this study to prescribe PFT classification to training plots as C3-majority or C4-majority plots.
- **[Moderation Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MOD09Q1)**: MODIS surface reflectance data are collected from the Terra Surface Reflectance 8-Day Global 250m (MOD09Q1.006) dataset. In this study, MODIS surface reflectance data was collected from 2010 to 2020 at each training and testing plot on an 8-day interval. For training plots spanning multiple pixels, the average reflectance value of the pixels within the training plot’s boundaries was used instead. NDVI can be calculated from MODIS surface reflectance data as (Band1 – Band2) / (Band1 + Band2), with Band1 representing the near-infrared band and Band2 representing the red band.
- **[Copernicus](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2_SR)**: Within this study, precipitation and temperature data were collected from 2010 to 2020 at each testing plot on a daily interval from Copernicus’ ERA5 daily aggregate dataset.
- **[National Land Cover Database (NLCD)](https://www.mrlc.gov/national-land-cover-database-nlcd-2016)**: The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) is a 30-m resolution nationwide land cover dataset based on the Landsat satellite. Amongst the land cover classes delineated by NLCD 2016, four land classes are considered herbaceous: Shrub/Scrub, Grassland/Herbaceous, Pasture/Hay, and Barren Land. These four land cover classes were extracted to generate an herbaceous land cover mask to ensure that training and testing sites only occupied herbaceous lands.
