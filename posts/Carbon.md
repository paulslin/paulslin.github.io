# S-CAP Carbon Visualization in Developing Countries
---
**Site Designer**: Paul Lin
**Collaborators**: Christine Evans, Emil Cherrington, Billy Ashmall, and Francisco Delgado (United Space Research Association)

**Date**: December 2021

**Project Description:** 
SERVIR Carbon Pilot (S-CAP) is a joint USAID & NASA initaitive to track global carbon dioxide emissions across developing countries.  As carbon dioxide emission indicators are wide and variable, the interface's goal is to develop a an easy-to-use, one stop shop for carbon accounting where users can visualize changes in land use/ land cover and their respective emission estimates, generate plots for forest distribution, carbon distribution, and emission stock over time.

## Data
---
#### Datasets
Three sets of environmental indicators were considered:
- Land Conver: JAXA, MODIS, Hansen Global Forest Watch
- Aboveground Biomass: Above Ground ORNL, IPCC Tier 1, Saatchi 2011, Avitable 2015, Geocarbon
- Change: JAXA, MODIS, Hansen Global Forest Watch, LandTrendR, Vegetation Peak

## Area of Interests
---
The website's area of interests are 11 pilot countries paterned with SERVIR within Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  While the site primarily focuses on these 11 countries, data analysis and collection is available on a global-scale.
